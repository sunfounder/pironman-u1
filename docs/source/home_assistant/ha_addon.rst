3. Home Assistant Addon
=========================

Pironman U1 offers a Home Assistant addon, facilitating the use of Pironman U1 for Home Assistant users.

.. note::

    The addon only supports direct installation of the Home Assistant system on Raspberry Pi, and does not support installing Home Assistant as a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi system.
    
    For this scenario, please directly :ref:`install_spc`.

Now we will install the Pironman U1 addon for Home Assistant. Choose one of the following two methods to add it.

1. Automatic Addition

#. Instructions for Powering On and Off:

  * **Power On**: Press the button until the light turns green, indicating the system is powering on. You can then release the button.
  * **Shutdown**: Press and hold the button for 2 seconds until the light turns purple, then release. When the power button's light begins to flash purple, the Raspberry Pi will receive a shutdown signal and proceed to shut down. The power button's light will turn off once the shutdown process is complete.
  * **Power Cut**: If you haven't configured software on the Raspberry Pi, or for other reasons, you can opt for a power cut shutdown. Press and hold the button for 5 seconds and turns red, indicating a direct power cut. Be cautious with this method as it may damage data.
